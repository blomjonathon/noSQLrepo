# NoSQL Social Media App
## Description
This app basically has API routes and models set up so that a social media company can have multiple users, their info, thoughts from that user, and all the basic CRUD functions for all users and thoughts along with them. It uses MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose. When routes are tested in postman, they handle the data correctly for all CRUD operations with various routes.
